Here are the aim, theory, and algorithms in short for all the topics you listed:


---

1. Naïve Bayes

Aim

To classify data based on probability using Bayes’ Theorem.

Theory

It is a probabilistic classifier.

Assumes features are independent (Naïve assumption).

Uses Bayes’ Theorem to compute the probability of each class.


Algorithm

1. Calculate prior probability for each class.


2. Calculate likelihood probability of features given a class.


3. Apply Bayes’ theorem:



P(class|features) = \frac{P(features|class)\cdot P(class)}{P(features)}

2. Apriori Algorithm

Aim

To find frequent itemsets and generate association rules in market basket analysis.

Theory

Uses support and confidence to find frequent patterns.

Works level-wise: frequent 1-itemsets → 2-itemsets → 3-itemsets.

Uses Apriori property:
If an itemset is frequent, all its subsets must also be frequent.


Algorithm

1. Generate frequent 1-itemsets (L1).


2. Use L1 to generate candidate sets for L2.


3. Count support and keep only those  minimum support.


4. Repeat until no more itemsets can be generated.


5. Generate association rules from frequent itemsets.
